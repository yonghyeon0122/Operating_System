# To Do List

Intermediate Submission
####################################
A single request (wget http://127.0.0.1.<PORT_NUM> other terminals) from a client can be handled by a single dispatcher thread
Queue is not required at this point
The request should be printed to the terminal
e.g.) fprintf(stderr, "Dispatcher Received Request: fd{%d] request{%s]\n", <insert_fd>, <insert_str>);

Functions

getContentType(): Figure out the requested file type - .html? .jpg? .gif? .txt?
readFromDisk(): malloc the memory space. Open, read the file from disk into memory
dispatch(): Receive a single request from a client
