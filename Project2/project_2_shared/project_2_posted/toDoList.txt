Things left to do 10_23_22:

Changes and questions 10_23_22:
1. Cannot open the second URL on the same tab -> the pipe should't closed after write
2. Do we have to close all the pipes in the end? 
3. Adding to the favorite list: can we add the same URL multiple time? -> currently we can add it as much as we can
	-> Solved: we can use fav_ok() which are already implemented
4. BAD TAB means typing URL to the non-existing tab -> check "free" flag to see whether the tab is opened
5. menu_item_selected_cb() is done
6. TAB_IS_DEAD: set the "free" into 1 (make the index available again)
